# automate-jw: Automate jwhitlock

This project is a set of scripts and documentation for automating my task
workflow. My goal is to have a keyboard shortcut that says:

    "Do what I normally do with what I'm currently seeing"

Often, "what I see" is a webpage in Safari or Firefox, and "what I normally do"
is add a task to [OmniFocus][], which I use for personal project management. I
use Apple stuff (macOS, iPhone, etc.), which includes automation tools like
[Shortcuts][], so it should be possible to encode the rules for what I'd like
to do.
