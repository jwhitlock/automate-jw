# automate-jw: Automate jwhitlock

This project is a set of scripts and documentation for automating my task
workflow. My goal is it get to a point where I have a keyboard shortcut that
say:

    "Do what I normally do with what I'm currently seeing"

Often, "what I see" is a webpage in Safari or Firefox, and "what I normally do"
is add a task to [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus), which I
use for personal project management. I use Apple stuff (macOS, iPhone, etc.),
which includes automation tools like
[Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts-mac), so it should be
possible to encode the rules for what I'd like to do.
